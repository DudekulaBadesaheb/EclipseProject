        in buildings, which include pipes,<br />
        fixtures, and equipment. They may also work with pipes that transport
        natural gas. Plumbers may work in <br />
        residential or commercial buildings, and may be called out to respond to
        emergencies. <strong>Athoe by "badesaheb"</strong>

      <article>Carpenter information</article>
      <p>
        Carpentry is a skilled trade and a craft in which the primary work
        performed is the cutting, <br />
        shaping and installation of building materials during the construction
        of buildings, ships, timber bridges, concrete <br />
        formwork, etc. Carpenters traditionally worked with natural wood and did
        rougher work such as framing, but today many other materials are also
        <br />
        used[1] and sometimes the finer trades of cabinetmaking and furniture
        building are considered carpentry. In the United States, 98.5% of <br />
        carpenters are male, and it was the fourth most male-dominated
        occupation in the country in 1999. In 2006 in the United States, there
        <br />
        were about 1.5 million carpentry positions. Carpenters are usually the
        first tradesmen on a job and the last to <br />[2] Carpenters normally
        framed post-and-beam buildings until the end of the 19th century; <br />
        now this old-fashioned carpentry is called timber framing. Carpenters
        learn this trade <br />by being employed through an apprenticeship
        training—normally four years—and qualify by <br />successfully
        completing that country's competence test in places such as the United
        Kingdom, the United States, <br />Canada, Switzerland, Australia and
        South Africa.[3] It is also common that the skill can <br />
        be learned by gaining work experience other than a formal training
        program, which may <br />be the case in many places.

      <p>
        A goldsmith is a metalworker who specializes in working with gold and
        other precious metals. Nowadays they mainly specialize in jewelry-making
        but historically, goldsmiths have also made silverware, platters,
        goblets, decorative and serviceable utensils, and ceremonial or
        religious items. Goldsmiths must be skilled in forming metal through
        filing, soldering, sawing, forging, casting, and polishing. The trade
        has very often included <br />jewelry-making skills, as well as the very
        similar skills of the silversmith. Traditionally, <br />these skills had
        been passed along through apprenticeships; more recently jewelry arts
        schools, specializing in <br />teaching goldsmithing and a multitude of
        skills falling under the jewelry arts umbrella,<br />
        are available. Many universities and junior colleges also offer
        goldsmithing, silversmithing, <br />
        and metal arts fabrication as a part of their fine arts curriculum.
