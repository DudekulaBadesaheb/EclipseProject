Treeset
~~~~~~~~

// A Binary Tree Data Structure
// It is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children,
// referred to as the left child and the right child. 
// It is commonly used for efficient storage and retrieval of data, 
// with various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

// TreeSet uses Tree Data Structure. 
// TreeSet maintains natural ordering of elements.
// Objects in a TreeSet are stored in a sorted and ascending order.
// Duplicate Values are not allowed.

// The insertion of null values into a TreeSet throws NullPointerException 
// because while insertion of null, it gets compared to the existing elements, 
// and null cannot be compared to any value.

// TreeSet serves as an excellent choice for storing large amounts of 
// sorted information which are supposed to be accessed quickly 
// because of its faster access and retrieval time.
