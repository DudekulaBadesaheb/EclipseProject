Iterator
~~~~~~~~~
 Iterators in Java are used in the Collection framework to 
 retrieve elements one by one. 
 It is a universal iterator as we can apply it to any Collection object. 
 By using Iterator, we can perform both read and remove operations. 
 It is an improved version of Enumeration with the additional 
 functionality of removing an element.

 Iterator must be used whenever we want to enumerate elements in all 
 Collection framework implemented interfaces like Set, List, Queue, Deque, 
 and all implemented classes of Map interface. 
 The iterator is the only cursor available for the entire collection framework.
 An iterator object can be created by calling the iterator() method present 
 in the Collection interface.

 SYNTAX
 Iterator itr = c.iterator();

 An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections
 like ArrayList and HashSet. 

 It is called an "iterator" because "iterating" is the technical term
 for looping.
