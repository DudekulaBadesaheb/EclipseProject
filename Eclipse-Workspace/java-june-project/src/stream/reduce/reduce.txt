Reduce Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// reduce()
// The reduce method is used to reduce the elements of a stream to a single value. 
// The reduce method takes a BinaryOperator as a parameter.

// sum(), min(), max(), count() etc. are some examples of reduce operations. 
// reduce() explicitly asks you to specify how to reduce the data 
// that made it through the stream.
