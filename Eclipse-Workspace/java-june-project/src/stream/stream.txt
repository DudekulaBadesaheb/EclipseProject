Stream API
~~~~~~~~~~~

Stream API is a way to express and process collection of objects. 
Stream API enable us to perform operations like
filtering, mapping, reducing and sorting.

There are two types of Operations in Streams.

1. Intermediate Operations.
2. Terminal Operations.

Characteristics of Intermediate Operations.
1. Methods are chained together.
2. Intermediate operations transform a stream into another stream.
3. It enables the concept of filtering where one method filters data
and passes it to another method after processing.

Important Intermediate Operations.
1. map()
2. filter()
3. sorted()

Terminal Operations
Terminal Operations return the result.
These Operations are not processed further and just return a 
final result value.

Important Terminal Operations.
1. collect()
2. forEach()
3. reduce()
